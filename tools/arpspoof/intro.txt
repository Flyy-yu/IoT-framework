What we do is the following: We constantly send the victim computer ARP answers telling him
that the MAC address belonging to the IP of the gateway machine (router) is our MAC address.
After some time the victim computer will believe us and makes a wrong entry in his ARP cache.
Next time the victim wants to send an IP packet to the gateway he sends the ethernet frame to
our MAC address so actually we get the IP packet. We do the same thing with the gateway machine
just the other way round.
