SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS encrypted network connections.
 It is intended to be useful for network forensics, application security analysis and penetration testing.

SSLsplit is designed to transparently terminate connections that are redirected to it using a network
address translation engine. SSLsplit then terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to
the original destination address, while logging all data transmitted. Besides NAT based operation,
SSLsplit also supports static destinations and using the server name indicated by SNI as upstream
destination. SSLsplit is purely a transparent proxy and cannot act as a HTTP or SOCKS proxy configured
in a browser.
