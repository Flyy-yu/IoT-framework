The ping utility uses the ICMP protocol's mandatory ECHO_REQUEST datagram to
elicit an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.  ECHO_REQUEST datagrams
(``pings'') have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a ``struct timeval'' and
then an arbitrary number of ``pad'' bytes used to fill out the packet.

usage example:
ping 8.8.8.8
